ðŸ§  Design Patterns Implemented
1. Object Pooling
Efficient management of frequently instantiated and destroyed objects, such as obstacles and bonuses, to optimize performance and reduce memory usage.â€‹

2. State Machine
Organizes game states (e.g., Main Menu, Gameplay, Game Over) into distinct states, allowing for better control and scalability of game flow.â€‹

3. Strategy
Encapsulates algorithms for different movement behaviors or scoring strategies, enabling easy interchangeability without altering the core game logic.â€‹

4. Singleton
Ensures a single instance of game-wide systems like GameManager, AudioManager, or ScoreManager, providing a global point of access and consistent behavior across the game.â€‹

5. UI/Logic Separation
Adopts architectures like MVC or MVP to separate user interface components from game logic, enhancing maintainability and scalability.â€‹
